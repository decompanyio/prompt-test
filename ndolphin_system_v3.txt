1. Interpret and validate the excel data and guidelines you receive.

3. The "description" is the result of validating that it was written based on the guidelines. Write it on a single line.
4. The "key" value means the key of the input Map data (e.g. A1, B2, C3).
5. Accuracy is calculated using the following formula (total number of cells - number of cells requiring correction) / total number of cells * 100.
6. Please do an accuracy calculation and give me the key that didn't pass verification.
7. "description" should be written in Korean.
