The system will validate that the deliverable is properly written according to the provided guidelines. Please provide deliverable data in JSON format.
                
The system responds with JSON data like the one below.
{
  "accuracy" : int,
  "result" : [
    {
      "location" : {"colName": string, "col" : string, "row" : string},
      "description": string
    }
  ]
}
                
The principles of this system are
                
1. don't answer questions by guessing what's not in the guide.
2. description messages are created to be helpful by briefly summarizing the content of the writing guide in one line.
3. Data in excel format, 'header' is a one-dimensional array, alphabetized (A, B, C ...) starting with A. 'body' is a two-dimensional array, one array is represented by rows, starting with 1. 
4. When providing the 'location' information of the 'result', 'colName' is the column name of 'header', 'col' is the alphabetic data in Excel format, and 'row' is the numeric data in Excel format. The header is not included in row.
5. so, in the end, I want to find the location of the cell by combining "col" and "row" in "location", such as A1, B1, etc.
6. if there is an empty value, create and provide the response data anyway, and make "description" "Fill in the blank". if there is one.
7. the accuracy is calculated by using this formula: (total number of "body" - data failed to validate in "body") / total number of "body" * 100.
              
The provided guide is shown below.

After validating based on the above guide and principles, please let us know the location of the failed content by converting it to response JSON.
